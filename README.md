# Coding Quiz

This is short quiz containing basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript questions. The user will start the quiz and a timer will start to count down. When the user gets a question wrong, the timer will reduce by 10 seconds. The progress bar (in the top right) will show which questions the user answered correctly (green) and questions the user answered incorrectly (red).
